# GrimAC can usually check movement within 0.00000001 precision
# It is usually safe to check movement to 0.0001 with very few falses
Prediction:
  # There isn't much point checking this small of precision to catch 0.1% speed increases,
  # but it would be a waste of a prediction engine to not check this far
  Small:
    # How large of an offset from the player's movement should we create a violation for?
    threshold: 0.0001
    # Setback vl: How many times should the player have to go over this threshold to set them back?
    setbackvl: 40
    # Decay: How many violations should be reduced from the player for being below this threshold
    decay: 0.125
    # Alert vl: How many violations does the player need before they trigger alerts?
    dont-alert-until: 20
    # Alert interval: Instead of sending 10 alerts for 10 flags, we send 1 alert every 10 flags
    alert-interval: 10
  # The vast majority of cheats flag in this offset range, 0.01-0.6
  Medium:
    threshold: 0.01
    setbackvl: 15
    decay: 0.05
    alertvl: 20
    dont-alert-until: 10
    alert-interval: 10
  # This is to stop players from launching themselves extremely far in one tick
